\title{Pooled design-space covariance and shared ruler}
\usage{
dkge_pooled_cov_q(B_list, X_list, Omega_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{B_list}{List of q×P subject beta matrices.}

\item{X_list}{List of T×q subject design matrices.}

\item{Omega_list}{Optional list of spatial weights.}
}
\value{
List containing `C` (pooled covariance in the ruler metric), `R`
  (upper-triangular shared ruler), and `G` (pooled design Gram matrix).
}
\description{
Computes the q×q pooled design covariance and the corresponding shared ruler
needed for fast kernel alignment screening.
