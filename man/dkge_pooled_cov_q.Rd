\title{Pooled design-space covariance and Cholesky factor}
\usage{
dkge_pooled_cov_q(B_list, X_list, Omega_list = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{B_list}{List of qxP subject beta matrices.}

\item{X_list}{List of Txq subject design matrices.}

\item{Omega_list}{Optional list of spatial weights.}
}
\value{
List containing `C` (pooled covariance in the ruler metric), `R`
  (upper-triangular Cholesky factor), and `G` (pooled design Gram matrix).
}
\description{
Computes the qxq pooled design covariance and the corresponding Cholesky factor
needed for fast kernel alignment screening.
