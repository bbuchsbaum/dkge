\title{Kernel alignment pre-screening}
\usage{
dkge_kernel_prescreen(K_grid, C, normalize_k = TRUE, top_k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{K_grid}{Named list of qxq kernels.}

\item{C}{Pooled covariance matrix.}

\item{normalize_k}{Logical; if `TRUE`, kernels are scaled to unit trace before
alignment.}

\item{top_k}{Number of kernels to retain.}
}
\value{
Data frame sorted by decreasing alignment; the `top` attribute carries
  the names of the retained kernels.
}
\description{
Ranks candidate kernels by their alignment with the pooled design-space
covariance produced by [dkge_pooled_cov_q()].
}
