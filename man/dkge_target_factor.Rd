\usage{
dkge_target_factor(
  fit,
  factor,
  residualize = TRUE,
  collapse = NULL,
  scope = "within_subject"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{dkge object containing `kernel_info$map` metadata.}

\item{factor}{Factor name.}

\item{residualize}{Logical; if `TRUE` (default) residualise higher-order
targets against previously constructed lower-order targets.}

\item{collapse}{Optional named list describing how to collapse factors that do
not appear in a target. Each entry may be `"mean"`,
`list(method = "mean", window = 3:8)`, or a numeric vector of length equal
