\title{K-orthogonal projector onto span(T) in effect space}
\usage{
dkge_projector_K(T, K)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{q×q0 matrix whose columns span the subspace of interest.}

\item{K}{q×q positive semi-definite design kernel.}
}
\value{
List with entries `P_K` (effect-space projector) and `P_hat`
  (projector in the K^{1/2} metric).
}
\description{
Builds both the K-selfadjoint projector operating in effect coordinates and
the Euclidean projector in the K^{1/2} metric. These projectors are useful
for CPCA-style splits of the compressed covariance.
