\title{K-orthogonal projector onto span(T) in effect space}
\usage{
dkge_projector_K(T, K)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{qxq0 matrix whose columns span the subspace of interest.}

\item{K}{qxq positive semi-definite design kernel.}
}
\value{
List with entries `P_K` (effect-space projector) and `P_hat`
  (projector in the K^{1/2} metric).
}
\description{
Builds both the K-selfadjoint projector operating in effect coordinates and
the Euclidean projector in the K^{1/2} metric. These projectors are useful
for CPCA-style splits of the compressed covariance.
}
\details{
All computations take place in the metric induced by the design kernel
`K`. Choosing a non-identity kernel therefore changes the projector: smooth
kernels diffuse energy across correlated effects, whereas a diagonal kernel
keeps the split tied to the raw effect indices. When the design-aligned
subspace is not well represented by coordinate axes, supply `cpca_T` with
columns that already capture the kernel geometry so the CPCA basis respects
those relationships.
