\title{Group-LOCO anchor importance (zeroing proxy)}
\usage{
dkge_info_map_loco(
  fit,
  clf,
  renderer,
  neighborhoods = NULL,
  k_nn = 32,
  aggregate = c("mean", "sum")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{Fitted `dkge` object.}

\item{clf}{Cross-fitted classifier from [dkge_cv_train_latent_classifier()].}

\item{renderer}{Renderer produced by [dkge_build_renderer()].}

\item{neighborhoods}{Optional list of integer vectors defining anchor
neighbourhoods. When `NULL`, the function derives them from the renderer's
anchor graph.}

\item{k_nn}{When neighbourhoods are not supplied, limits the automatically
derived neighbourhood size.}

\item{aggregate}{Aggregation method across subjects: `"mean"` or `"sum"`.}
}
\value{
A list with LOCO scores per anchor, per-subject anchor maps, and the
  neighbourhood definition.
}
\description{
Approximates the influence of each anchor by zeroing its neighbourhood in the
subject maps derived from classifier weights and accumulating the lost margin
magnitude across subjects.
