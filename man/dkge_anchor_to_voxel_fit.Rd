\title{Fit a sparse anchor-to-voxel decoder}
\usage{
dkge_anchor_to_voxel_fit(anchors, vox_xyz, k = 8, sigma = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{anchors}{Anchor coordinate matrix (`Q x 3`).}

\item{vox_xyz}{Voxel coordinate matrix (`V x 3`).}

\item{k}{Number of anchors per voxel (default 8).}

\item{sigma}{Optional Gaussian length-scale. If `NULL`, it is set to the
square root of the median squared distance between voxels and their
nearest anchors.}
}
\value{
A decoder object storing neighbour indices, weights, and a sparse
  matrix implementing the transformation.
}
\description{
Each voxel is represented as a convex combination of its `k` nearest
anchors using Gaussian weights. The result can be reused to decode
any anchor-level map.
