\arguments{
\item{B_list}{List of q×P subject beta matrices.}

\item{X_list}{List of T×q subject design matrices.}

\item{K_grid}{Named list of candidate kernels.}

\item{ranks}{Integer vector of ranks to evaluate.}

\item{Omega_list}{Optional list of spatial weights.}

\item{ridge}{Optional ridge parameter passed to [dkge_fit()].}

\item{w_method}{Subject-level weighting scheme passed to [dkge_fit()].}

\item{w_tau}{Shrinkage parameter toward equal weights passed to [dkge_fit()].}

\item{top_k}{Number of kernels to keep after pre-screening.}
}
\value{
List with the selected `kernel` and `rank`, alignment and CV tables,
  and a per-kernel summary of scores at the selected rank.
}
\description{
Runs kernel alignment pre-screening followed by LOSO explained-variance
cross-validation, applying the one-standard-error rule to pick a kernel/rank
pair.
