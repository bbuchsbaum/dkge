Description: Implements Design-Kernel Group Embedding (DKGE) for design-aware
    cluster-level fMRI analysis. Provides streaming and memory-light estimators,
    leave-one-subject-out cross-fitting, kernel-based design alignment, and
    optimal transport to medoid parcellations. Integrates with
    neuroimaging toolkits such as 'neuroim2', 'fmridesign', and 'fmriAR'.
